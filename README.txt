Project name: EEG Signal Analysis

Group members:
-> Kamarthi Litheesh Kumar
-> Kamalapuram Sreenivasulu Reddy
-> Kakarla Venkata Sesha Sai Pavanteja

Abstract:
-> EEG bands are extracted from EEG signals using wavelet transform.
-> EEG bands are converted to frequency domain from time domain using FFT.
-> Plot of EEG signal,Calculated Power Spectral Density, Average Power, Absolute Power of Theta band, Relative Power of theta and alpha bands.
-> We used periodogram, welchâ€™s, multitaper methods to estimate the power spectral density.
-> Multitaper method is more accurate for estimation of Power spectral density of EEG signal.
